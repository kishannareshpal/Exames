### INFO
  App made to help students find exams easily. because you know how tedious it could be to find a specific exam.
  
  With this app, you just select it, and voila, it is right there on the tip of your finger. You can even open it inside teh app if you don't have/want any extra <b>"PDFReader"</b>. 

...............................

### Where are the files/exams i downloaded, located/saved?
  All of the exams that you download is stored into the root of the "Internal/External Storage" of your phone. And can be found in an automatically generated Folder called <b>"Exames-App"</b>.

    > ExternalStorageRootDirectory/Exames-App/  
    > InternalStorageRootDirectory/Exames-App/

  <b> Hint: If you want, you can use that location to share/open with a friend/app.</b>

.............................

### What else can this app do?
This app can also be used to determine whether or not you'll be eligible for an Exam Session. That is, you can calculate your overall through this app, and if it's higher that 13, than Congratulations, you passed and won't need to realize any exam. Otherwise, you will realize the exam, or in a bad luck, you will not even be eligible to realize one, sorry, it is not my fault. You are the one that must study man.

### Do you plan to add more features to this app?
Yes, i'll be constantly updating this app, fixing bugs (cause you know, bugs are invincible) and hopefully adding/improving some features here and there.

As of now, i'm looking forward to add a feature that let's the user upload an exam that is not yet available on the server. Maybe when v.2.0 comes out, it will roll out with this feature., or even i can add it on an 1.x update due to excitement. LOL. Ya'll never know.

### Can i help you?
Yes indeed. You are the only thing i have to be able to make this app see Heaven.

Jokes aside.
You can help me reporting bugs and leaving a review in the playsore.
