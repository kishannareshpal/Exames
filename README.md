# Versions:
## 1.0:
> Release build.

## 1.1:
> Added [fancyButton Library](https://github.com/medyo/Fancybuttons) to have a uniform look of the button even on Older devices. 
> Implemented the FancyButton Library by Mehdi Sakout to fix some of the visuals on lower versions of Android. 
> Fixed certain button styles appearing white Background with white Text. That didn't look good man. ~~But still didn't fix all of it. For now i implemented the: **if(Version is lesser than Lollipop){bButtonName.setTextColor(Color.BLACK)}**~~

## Beta 1.2:

> Added About page and Info. 
> Fixed the Visual bug on older Android versions once and for all. It means that now it has a Uniform look, independent of the Android Version. 
> Optimized.

### INFO
  Made by a Student for Students. This will definetely help you to study
  
  With this app, you just select it, and voila, it is right there on the tip of your finger. You can even open it inside teh app if you don't have/want any extra <b>"PDFReader"</b>. 

...............................

### Where are the files/exams i downloaded, located/saved?
  All of the files are stored into the root of the "Internal/External Storage" of your phone. It will generate a folder called <b>"Exames-App"</b> where everything will be saved.

    > ExternalStorageRootDirectory/Exames-App/  
    > InternalStorageRootDirectory/Exames-App/ 
    
 ** Can i delete the file from within the app?** 
 Ans: No, as of now, you can't. You can only delete it using a File Manager. Just like normal files. 
 
 ** Can i change the Save Directory (Internal/External)? **
 Ans: Not yet :(. The app will automatically find the appropriate one. Which has the most space. 
    
    > The file name will look like this: "Disciplina-Classe-Ano-Epoca.ext". 
    > E.g: xxxxxx-1Xa Classe-201x-x Epoca.pdf

  <b> Hint: You can use that location to delete/share/open the file.</b>



### What else can this app do?
> You can calculate the averages.


### Do you plan to add more features to this app?
Yes, i'll be constantly updating this app, fixing bugs (cause you know, bugs are invincible) and hopefully adding/improving some features here and there.

As of now, i'm looking forward to add a feature that let's the user upload an exam that is not yet available on the server. Maybe when v2.0 comes out, it will roll out with this feature.

### Can i (user) help you?
Yes indeed. You are the only thing i have to be able to make this app see Heaven. 
You can help me by reporting bugs and leaving a review in the playsore.
